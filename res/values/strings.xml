		Hyde Park Gym Workout Tool. This app records
		your workouts and tracks your progress.
		\n\n\u2022 Note that this app is descriptive, not proscriptive.
		That is, it doesn\'t tell
		you what you SHOULD do, it just keeps track of what you did.
		Come on,
		you\'re smart enough to know what sort of workout you want (or
		at least to find the information for yourself).
		\n\n\u2022 For general help about what a screen does, tap on
		the Hyde Park Gym logo at the top right of the screen.
		\n\n\u2022 For help on specific functions, long-tap (press and hold
		for a second or two)
		any button or widget, and a help message will pop up
		describing that function.
		\n\n\u2022 The first
		time you use this app, a few popular exercises are
		listed already listed. You will have to add your favorite
		exercises to the list. But the
		program will remember your exercises, so the next
		time you workout, you can simply select that
		exercise from the list.
		\n\n\u2022 Choose an exercise and record what
		you completed for that set. Do it again for each
		set. The data you
		enter is added to a database which can be viewed
		to track your progress.
		\n\n\u2022 You can change your name from the boring \'default
		user\' and add other users for this app by tapping on the name.
		It\'s a pretty nifty screen\u2014other cool bookkeeping stuff
		can be done there, check it out.
		\n\n\u2022 This app was created by Scott Morgan Biggs in his spare
		time. The good people at Hyde Park Gym in Austin, Texas provided invaluable help
		and assistance. They also trusted me with their good name, but
		are in no way responsible for any damage, frustration, or insults
		that may (or may not) crop up while using this app.  So you should
		send your hate messages to me through the Google Play site. I promise
		to do my best to address the issues (which may not be much\u2014I am
		very far from a programming god, sorry).
		\n\nAnyway, I did lots of
		this stuff in the middle of the night, so you might be amused or
		offended by some of these help messages. So it goes. But in any
		event, I hope this app is as useful to you as it has been to me.
		And THANKS to Brook and all the good people at HPG!
		\n\nHave a good workout!

		Create a new exercise on this screen.
		\n\n<b>name</b>\u003a Give this exercise a good name (something to easily distinguish
		it from other exercises).
		\n\n<b>exercise type</b>\u003a Exercises generally fall into two different types\u003a <i>anaerobic</i>
		and <i>aerobic</i>.
		\n\n\u0020\u2022 <i>Anaerobic</i> are strength building exercises like
		bench presses and squats.
		\n\n\u0020\u2022 <i>Aerobic</i> exercises build endurance
		and cardiovascular health (jogging, jump rope, and swimming
		are examples).
		\n\n\u0020\u2013 You need to tell this program what type of
		exercise this is because it does keep track, and we don\'t
		want to confuse how your muscles are worked!
		\n\n<b>muscle group</b>\u003a Which group of muscles
		you are using with this exercise? You don\'t have to be
		too specific; a rough guesstimate is good enough.
		\n\n<b>aspects</b>\u003a Select the
		checkbox to left for each measurement you want to record
		for this exercise. Uncheck to disable this measurement.
		\n\n\u00a0\u2022 Touch the drop-down to the right to select the unit
		of measurement.  If you want to create your own unit,
		select <i>customize</i> and fill in the following form.
		\n\n<b>significant</b>\u003a For each exercise, there is usually one measurement that
		is the most important. Select the radio button on the right
		side next to the measurement that is the most important
		part of this particular exercise.
		\n\n<b>other</b>\u003a This section allows you to customize an exercise.
		You can name both the <i>measurement</i> AND the <i>unit</i>. This is
		for those exercises that I just could not think of.
		\n\n\u2022 And like always, you can long-touch (touch and hold for
		two seconds) any widget and get specific help for that
		item.
		\n\n<u>Now for an example</u>\u003a
		\n\nA good friend is a competitive synchronized swimmer, and her
		team has some unusual exercises.
		\n\n\u2022 One of the exercises is called \'Smiling\', so she enters that
		for the <i>name</i>.
		\n\n\u2022 Repetitions are counted, so she checks <i>reps</i>.
		\n\n\u2022 There are no <i>levels</i> to this exercise, so she leaves this
		unchecked (levels are generally used with exercise machines
		like Stair Steppers or rowers).
		\n\n\u2022 Calories? Yes, she is quite concerned about calories, but
		there is no simple way to measure them.  So <i>calories</i> is left blank.
		\n\n\u2022 Smiling is not <i>weighted</i> (imagine if it were!), so that remains unchecked.
		\n\n\u2022 However there is a distance, so she checks <i>distanced</i>
		and taps on the drop-down button and selects <i>millimeters</i>.
		\n\n\u2022 Time is measured for this exercise, so she checks <i>timed</i>.
		They do this exercise to music, counting beats.  But beats
		are not in the time list, so she chooses <i>custom</i> from
		the drop-down list and types \'beats\' in the editbox.
		\n\n\u2022 But there is one more aspect to the Smiling workout that
		the program has not provided for\u003a glow. So my friend
		checks <i>other</i> and types \'glow\' in the textbox
		next to it.
		\n\nThe unit for glowing while smiling is called \'happies\', so
		she types this in the lower box.
		\n\n\u2022 Lastly, she must decide which of these is the most significant
		part of the smiling exercise. While glowing is very important, this
		is an exercise, and she most wants to keep track of the repetitions.
		So she selects the right-most radio button in the <i>reps</i> row.
		\n\n\u2022 Like most other programs, she hits <i>ok</i> to save the
		changes, or <i>cancel</i> to, ah, uh, cancel (sigh).
		\n\n\u2022 Remember, if you later decide to change this exercise, you can
		edit it by long-pressing the name in the main <b>grid</b>.
		\n\nYeah, that\'s a long explanation. But you deserve to
		really understand what you\'re doing. Right\?
		\n\nHave
		a great workout!

	<string name="editexer_help_msg">(Hoo boy, get ready for a long one!)
		\n\nThis screen gives you the
		ability to modify or delete an exercise. But I gotta start with
		a caveat\u003a
		\n\n<b>WARNING</b>\u003a\n
		\tChanging an exercise may have odd results
		on workout sets that have already been entered.
		\n\nI\'ll do my best to try to retain data, but
		some things just won\'t work (like changing the
		unit\u2014there is no way I can convert from the old
		unit to the new one without forcing you to enter
		some sort of formula, which is the sort of thing
		you\'re avoiding by using a computer, right\?).
		\n\nConsequently, the sets you did before the change
		may be a little messed up. Of course you can edit those sets to fix
		the weirdness if you like. <b>end Warning</b>
		\n\n<b>name</b>\u003a\u00a0 The textbox near the top allows you to change the
		name. \u2013Ha, that was easy!
		\n\n<b>exercise type</b>\u003a\u00a0 Exercises generally fall
		into two different types, <i>anaerobic</i>
		and <i>aerobic</i>.
		\n\u00a0\u2022 <i>Anaerobic</i> are strength building exercises like
		bench presses and squats.
		\n\u00a0\u2022 <i>Aerobic</i> exercises build endurance
		and cardiovascular health (jogging, jump rope, and swimming
		are examples).
		\n\u00a0\u2014 You need to tell this program what type of
		exercise this is because it does keep track of these things, and we don\'t
		want to confuse how your muscles are worked!
		\n\n<b>muscle group</b>\u003a\u00a0 This program wants to know which group of muscles
		you are using with this exercise. You don\'t have to be
		too specific; a rough guesstimate is good enough.
		\n\n<b>aspects</b>\u003a\u00a0 Select the
		checkbox on the left for each measurement (aspect) you want to record
		for this exercise. Uncheck to disable this measurement.
		\n\n<b>unit</b>\u003a\u00a0 If applicable, touch the drop-down to the right
		of the checkbox to select the unit
		of measurement. If you want to create your own unit,
		select <i>customize</i> at the bottom of the list.
		\n\n<b>significant</b>\u003a\u00a0 For each exercise, there is usually one measurement that
		is the most important, which I call the <i>significant</i> aspect. Select the radio button on the right
		side next to the measurement that is the most important
		part of this particular exercise. You can skip entries, but not the
		<i>significant</i> entry.
		\n\n<b>other</b>\u003a\u00a0 This section allows you to completely customize.
		You can name both the <i>measurement</i> AND the <i>unit</i>. This is
		a catch-all to allow plenty of customization.
		\n\nAnd like always, you can long-touch (touch and hold for
		two seconds) any widget and get specific help for that
		item.
		\n\n<u>Now for an example</u>\u003a
		\n\nMy buddy is a tiddly-winks champion and trains with a very specific
		exercise called winking.
		\n\n\u2022 So he types \'winking\' for the <i>name</i>.
		\n\n\u2022 Winking doesn\'t quite fit into either the standard
		exercise types, so he chooses <i>misc</i>.
		\n\n\u2022 This exercise uses fingers and lots of kneeling, so for
		the muscle group he selects <i>all</i>.
		\n\n\u2022 He always count repetitions, so he checks <i>reps</i>.
		\n\n\u2022 There are no <i>levels</i> to this exercise, so he leaves this
		unchecked (levels are generally used with exercise machines
		like Stair Steppers or rowers).
		\n\n\u2022 Counting calories\? for tiddly-winks\? You gotta be kidding!
		\n\n\u2022 Winks do have a weight, so he checks <i>weighted</i>.
		He then presses on the drop-down nextdoor and select <i>grains</i>,
		the unit of weight for a wink.
		\n\n\u2022 When winking, they do go a distance, but that is not important
		(accuracy is), so he leaves this unchecked.
		\n\n\u2022 Time is not an issue in this sport, so that also remains
		unchecked.
		\n\n\u2022 But there is one more aspect to the tiddly-winks workout that
		the program has not provided for\u003a accuracy. So my friend
		checks <i>other</i> and types \'accuracy\' for the <i>name</i>.
		\n\n\u2022 The <i>unit</i> for accuracy while winking is \'tiddles\', so
		he types this in too.
		\n\n\u2022 Almost done\u2014he must decide which of these is the most significant
		part of the winking exercise. While accuracy is important, this
		is an exercise, and he wants to keep track of the repetitions.
		So he selects the right-most radio button in the <i>reps</i> row.
		\n\n\u2022 Finally he hits <b>execute changes</b> to save this
		exercise. If he decided he didn\'t want this exercise after all he would tap <b>cancel</b>.
		\n\nThat\'s it.  Sorry for the long explanation, but I think it\'s
		better to bore you to tears rather than letting you languish in confusion.
		\n\nHave a great workout!

		Okay, this is a little esoteric,
		but if you hang on with me, I think we can get this figured out.
		\n\nIn case you come up with an exercise that has some sort
		of measurement that is NOT a repetition, level, calorie, weight,
		distance, or some sort of elapsed time, you can fill this out
		to fulfill this need.
		\n\nAs an avid rocket skater, I need to measure the volume of
		rocket fuel that I ingest because, as you
		well know, the more fuel you drink the faster you go. So
		for this particular exercise, I simply force myself to drink
		as much as I can (tasty!).
		\n\nHowever, you can see that volume is not a measurement that
		I have listed. Wouldn\'t it be nice to record and keep track
		of how much (volume) I\'m forcing down my throat\?
		\n\nThis space is where you name
		that measurement. I am going to type in \"volume\" for this entry,
		which is the name of the measurement. The actual unit will
		go in the next textbox.
		\n\nYeah, that\'s as clear as mud. Sorry, I\'m doing
		my best; I\'m a programmer, not a writer.
		</string>

		<string name="add_other_unit_et_help_title">The UNIT For this Measurement</string>
	<string name="add_other_unit_et_help_msg">Continuing from the help on
		the previous textbox (\"other Name\"), we still need to record
		the unit of volume for this exercise.
		\n\nYes, we rocket skaters are an odd group, and when we drink we
		REALLY drink. Since rocket fuel is measured in liters, that
		would be a good way to measure our drinking.
		\n\nBut since we feed our head with this foamy redish brown fuel,
		rocket skaters prefer the word \'redhead\' over liters.
		\n\nSo I would simply type \"redheads\" in this textbox.
		\n\nAnd every
		time I do this exercise, it will ask me, \"How many redheads
		did you do in this set\?\"  And I will grin quietly.

		notes from your previous set are just a hint\u2014it will
		disappear when you save or start writing something else.)

		\n\n\u2022 Input the numbers and any comments and don\'t forget
		to press
		<i>enter set</i>! That\'s how this program knows to enter
		this information into the database, duh.

		\n\n\u2022 Select a radio button that indicates how hard this
		set has been for you (I call it the <b>stress</b> condition).
		The first choice means that this exercise set was just
		right\u2014you had to push to complete it.

		\n\nIf the workout was too easy or you\'re ready to
		up the amps, select the next radio button, an image
		of someone lifting a weight that is too light.

		\n\nIf this set was so hard
		that you could not finish, tap on the third button (too
		heavy).

		\n\nI hope your exercises never come to this, but
		if something
		odd or bad does happen (accident, injury, etc),
		press the last button, ouch! At least you can record
		exactly what you were doing and when it happened.

		\n\n\u2022 The notes section is there for whatever pops up,
		usually relevant to the set you just did.  Of course you\'re
		welcome to write that great novel you\'ve been thinking
		of while catching your breath between sets.

		\n\n\u2022 If you\'re like me and have big bulky fingers, you
		can change the width of the number wheel thingies by hitting

		(Of course, if you don\'t
		see anything they\'re probably already turned off.)
		\n\n\u2022 Lastly, if you leaving an item blank is ok as long as

		\n\nThe opposite of too easy is too hard (duh!).
		I drew some wobbly arms and legs to represent

		finishing the set. Seriously consider

		and annoying while working out, so I disable the screensaver when this
		app is running. You can disable my screen saver\'s disabler \u003a)
		\n\n\u2022Number Wheels\u003a When adding information to an exercise set,
		I added some wheels (or dials if you prefer) as a fun user interface.
		If you don\'t think they\'re fun, simply disable them; doing so can
		greatly increase the room for small phones.
		\n\n\u2022Fat Wheels\u003a If you <i>do</i> have wheels, the gentlemen may
		be having problems using them as the wheels are so narrow. Enable this
		preference and see the nice big plump wheels, perfect for manly fingers!
		\n\n\u2022Chronological\u003a When displaying the history of a single
		exercise in the <b>History</b> tab, you have the option of ordering
		the workout sets chronologically or most recent first.
		\n\n\u2022Display Mode\u003a This pertains to the graphs of your workouts.

		you recorded. These dots can be so close together that can be kind of
		confusing. To simplify, you have the option of viewing your data on
		a daily basis.

		These buttons give you two options for how to display your
		workout data.
		\n\n<i>All sets</i> (default) graphs a point for every single exercise
		set you enter. If you do more than one set per day,
		you may see the graph clump the sets together so closely that you must zoom in a LOT to
		notice any difference.
		\n\n\u2022 <i>Daily</i> shows all the results of each day added up. This is kind of
		complicated. Here goes\u003a
		\n\nAll the repetions for a day are added together. So if you did one set
		of ten, another set of five, and a third set of just one, you will see
		16 graphed for <b>reps</b> that day.
		\n\nThe other aspects are similar to reps, but take repetitions into
		account.
		\n\nSo for that same exercise sets, if you did fifty pounds
		for the first set, eighty pounds for the second set, and one hundred pounds
		for the third set, you moved a grand total <b>weight</b> of 1000 pounds (10 x 50 +
		5 x 80 + 1 x 100 = 1000, \u2714 ).
		\n\nIf <b>reps</b> is not present for a
		particular exercise (like for jogging, which just includes time and distance), then no multiplication is done; the sets are simply
		added up for the day. So if you jogged for 2 miles in the morning, 1 mile during lunch,
		and burned off some steam after work by jogging 4 miles (whew!), then the
		daily <b>distance</b> would be 7 miles. Makes sense if you think about it.
		\n\nAs if that wasn\'t complicated enough, <b>levels</b> don\'t make sense
		to accumulate. So they are averaged for the day (yeah, a <i>weighted</i> average
		if <b>reps</b> are present\u2014for you nerds). This means that if you ran on an eliptical trainer
		at level eight for a while and then ran again at level ten, your daily <b>level</b>
		would be averaged to a 9. Makes sense, too, but you have to think harder about
		it.
		\n\nAnd finally, there\'s the aspect initially called <b>other</b>
		(you should have given it a more meaningful name when creating the exercise). Since
		this apect is quite customizable by the user (that\'s the main point of it), the program
		can\'t know how to summarize a day of these sets. So my best guess is to
		simply display the highest value for the day.
		\n\nSorry about the long help page, but there\'s a lot to explain here.
